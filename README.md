# Esther Yang 

### I am Esther, a strategy-addict who is in love with learning techniques, human behaviors, causal inference, and game theory. 
🇹🇼  I'm from Taiwan, currently @ Minerva University 🇺🇸 / Google Research Fellow, Prev: Meta

🔭 80% non-English native speaker constitutes my school, so I'm currently working on NLP research [Understand How English Fluency Affects Grading in Minerva](https://www.notion.so/selflearning/Project-Summary-c17648b746d147a286a6c057d5c55d10) to understand grading bias exists toward English fluency. 

🌱 I've previously worked on product analytics for healthcare devices, e-commerce analytics in consulting projects, algorithm and data structure curriculum design, and algorithms to identify duplicates in Metaverse.  

🤔 I'm looking for a new data science grad opportunity to sharpen my gain experience in experiments and machine learning.
